# Exploit Bridge User Guide

## 1. Overview
- **Purpose**: This guide provides instructions for connecting and using the Exploit Bridge by [Exploit Security](https://www.exploitsecurity.io/).
- **Target Audience**: This guide is designed for hackers and ethusiasts alike.
- **Exploit Bridge**: This Exploit Bridge was initially designed by [Exploit Security](https://www.exploitsecurity.io) for their field operatives. It's basic functionality is that of a USB to UART and SPI bridge. It allows for its user to interact with a device or component for troubleshooting and security research purposes.

## 2. Components and Parts
- **PCA Board Components**:
  - Resistors
  - Capacitors
  - Integrated Circuits (ICs)
  - Connectors
- **Part Identification**: Each component is marked in the assembly drawing with unique part numbers. Refer to the attached diagrams for precise placement and identification.

## 3. Assembly Process
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
  1. Place components onto the PCA board following the layout provided in the drawing.
  2. Solder the components at the designated soldering points.
  3. Attach connectors ensuring correct orientation as per the provided diagrams.
  4. Double-check component placement against the assembly drawing to avoid errors.
- **Orientation and Placement**: Ensure that components like ICs are oriented according to the markings on the board. Use the drawingâ€™s annotations as a reference.

## 4. Testing and Validation
- **Power-On Checks**: 
  - After assembly, connect the board to the power supply and check voltage at key test points.
  - Ensure LEDs, if present, light up as expected.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If components fail to operate, recheck soldering points and ensure all connections are secure.
  - Refer to the troubleshooting section for specific diagnostic steps based on component behavior.

## 5. Maintenance and Handling
- **Handling Precautions**:
  - Use ESD-safe tools and wear an anti-static wrist strap when handling the PCA to avoid damaging sensitive components.
- **Cleaning and Storage**:
  - Clean the board with an appropriate cleaning solution after soldering to remove flux residue.
  - Store the board in an anti-static bag to prevent damage.

## 6. Appendix
- **Diagrams and Tables**:
  - Refer to the detailed diagrams in the ES-EB-PCA-001-AD (MASTER) drawing for component placement and wiring instructions.
- **Glossary**:
  - **ESD**: Electrostatic Discharge
  - **PCA**: Printed Circuit Assembly
  - **IC**: Integrated Circuit
